I'd like to request optional vertical and horizontal guidelines that would be visible while mouse-trackballing across a window. They would accompany the Control-Point-Add cursor by showing both horizontal and vertical lines extending across the entire window width and height, to intersect the trackball position of the cursor. 

This would aid the manual georeferencing of maps from images with graticules and grid lines.
