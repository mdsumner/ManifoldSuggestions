Subject: feature suggestion - shapefile / OGR - pseudo standard
To: sales@manifold.net <sales@manifold.net>


Hello, it seems OGR/shapelib supports a pseudo-standard for deleting features from shapefiles: 

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2016-January/043483.html

Please add a feature to the shapefile importer to apply this filter, or to badge the objects with something like a "shapelib_deleted" attribute. 

To reproduce the behaviour, use the "sample_data.zip" shapefile from here: 
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11007

Manifold imports all 9 lines without applying this "deleted" filter. 

In R with rgdal we get a message from GDAL/OGR:

library(rgdal)
x <- readOGR(".", "vector_edited")
#OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
#Source: ".", layer: "vector_edited"
#with 4 features
#t has 2 fields
#Warning message:
#In readOGR(".", "vector_edited") : Deleted feature IDs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

## the number of line objects / rows in attribute table
length(x)
# [4]
nrow(as.data.frame(x))
# [4]

## object IDs revealing the 5 deleted from 0,...4
row.names(x)
# [1] "5" "6" "7" "8"

Cheers, Mike.
