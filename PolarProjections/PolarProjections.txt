Hello, 

I've attached versions of a polygon drawing of Antarctica in MIF and SHP format, in Longitude/Latitude and two polar projections. 

When importing the MIF files the Stereographic projection is not applied, though the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area and parameters is fine. With the shapefiles the projected drawings don't get the correct details from the .prj. 

Specific problems: 

1) antarctica_laea.shp - the LambertAzimuthal Equal Area projection is correctly chosen, but the Center Longitude and Center Latitude are still defaults, they should be 147 and -90 respectively. 

2) antarctica_stere.shp - there's no application of the Stereographic projection at all, it's in the default Orthographic

3) antarctica_stere.mif - there's no application of the Stereographic projection at all, it's in the default Orthographic



Please investigate and add the right PRJ interpretation to Manifold to fix problems 1) and 2). 

If it's a Manifold read problem with 3) please add that too. I believe the problem in MIF for 3) may be a limitation of that format, since the metadata doesn't round trip through GDAL anyway. 


Cheers, Mike.
